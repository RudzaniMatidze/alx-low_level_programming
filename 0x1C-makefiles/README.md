# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## What is a Makefile and how does it work?
- If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the make utility can come in handy. The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used make to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using make install.

## Tasks:

| File | Requirements |
| ---- | ------------ |
| [0-Makefile](./0-Makefile) | Create your first Makefile.<ul><li>name of the executable: school</li><li>rules: all (The all rule builds your executable),</li><li>variables: none</li></ul> |
| [1-Makefile](./1-Makefile) | <ul><li>name of the executable: school</li><li>rules: all (The all rule builds your executable)</li><li>variables: none</li></ul> |
| [2-Makefile](./2-Makefile) | Create your first useful Makefile.<ul><li>name of the executable: school</li><li>
